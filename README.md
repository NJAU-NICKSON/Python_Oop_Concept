# Python_Oop_Concept
This repository demonstrates basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python, including classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, and polymorphism.
This  repository  has **two files**:

* `Inheritance.py`
* `Polymorphism.py`


## Files

* **Inheritance.py**
  Contains an example of a `Car` class with attributes and methods, and an `ElectricCar` subclass that overrides behavior to demonstrate inheritance and polymorphism.

* **Polymorphism.py**
  Contains an example of multiple animal classes (`Dog`, `Fish`, `Bird`, `Snake`, `Horse`, `Kangaroo`) that all share the `move()` method but implement it differently to demonstrate polymorphism.

## How to Run

Clone the repository and run the Python scripts:

```bash
https://github.com/NJAU-NICKSON/Python_Oop_Concept.git

cd Python_Oop_Concept

python Inheritance.py

python Polymorphism.py
```

## Learning Goals

* Understand the structure of Python classes.
* Use constructors to initialize objects.
* Explore inheritance to extend base classes.
* Apply polymorphism to design flexible programs.
